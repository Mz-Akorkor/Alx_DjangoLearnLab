# LibraryProject

This Django project is the initial project setup for the ALX lesson on Django. It includes:

- `manage.py` for executing commands like `runserver`
- `settings.py`, `urls.py` within the internal `LibraryProject/` configuration directory

Next steps:
- Add apps
- Create views and templates
- Define URL patterns
